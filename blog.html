                <p>When people talk about mental health, all we can think of is depression. Depression is like the common cold of all mental disorders. <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">Repeatedly, people get sucked in by the clutches of depression. It haunts the best of us for years, while only a few manage to win over it. Depression makes us think that we aren't good enough for the world.

But, no one talks about the plethora of other mental issues and disorders that we, be it as teens or adults, go through. This dismisses the other issues that we experience, neglecting the very fact that we might be facing issues to begin with. Certainly, there are mental issues that need medical intervention. But, there is another kind, the kind that no one talks about, the kind that gets swept under the rug.

These include issues that manifest themselves as a symptom of an underlying, much bigger issue. These are caused by some sort of trauma (rejection, loss of a loved one, childhood issues) or by negative beliefs about ourselves, etc.

Anxiety is one of the things we face on a daily basis. It manifests as being afraid of normal things or overthinking, or might show up when we eat in front of someone else. What if the other person sees me eat? What if they hear me chewing? What if they can hear the growl coming from the pits of my stomach? Or what if I spill something over myself, and they see that? Or, think about talking to a stranger: How do I talk to a stranger? Am I being too clingy? Creepy, maybe? What if they are in a hurry, and I’m just taking up their time? It, consequently, affects our ability to perform normal day-to-day tasks.

Or think about how we are influenced by the media and the culture of six pack abs and an hourglass figure. This affects how we view ourselves, disabling us from loving and accepting ourselves the way we are, with the numerous scars, stretch marks, blemishes that all of us fear to display. Skinny people always want to get fatter, while the chubbier ones starve and exercise beyond normal to get into the ‘perfect shape’. Some start finding relief in eating, out of boredom or for that little hit of dopamine. We start viewing a perfect body as the panacea for our life problems.

Unable to gain control of our deteriorating lives, we stop seeing ourselves in a positive way. This impedes our ongoing journey towards self-love and increasing self-esteem. Eventually, it feels like we lack the basic shelving for the trophies that we get in the form of appreciation, love and appraisal from others. Unable to grieve and vent ourselves out during downfalls, we build walls and deep scars mount upon our carcass. We lash out time and again emotionally, or stop trusting the human race altogether as a result.

This is where people can change. Certainly, the world isn't as harsh a place as we imagine it to be. Not everyone is out there to judge or humiliate us. Only by allowing ourselves to take the necessary risks like sharing, writing, etc., can we become better. Only by seeking help, can we come out of this dark place. You are not alone, and the issues you face mentally, psychologically, don't need to be kept under wraps.

                <p>In a bid to build leadership of women in the community, we facilitated the formation of a women’s Self-Help Group (SHG)  in Dahri village of Jambusar, Gujarat called<span id="dots2">...</span><span id="more2"> Jai Swaminarayan Group.The members of this SHG belong to an erstwhile tribal community that migrated from the Sardar Sarovar Dam submergence area of Madhya Pradesh and rehabilitated here.

With a specific focus on improving their livelihoods in the current settlement, the group collectively identified potential areas of income generation. Since this was a cattle-rearing community, all members of the group had cows, buffaloes and goats. Therefore, they took up the idea of establishing a milk collection centre, with support from CARE India. This was a not an easy decision for them, as they were short of knowledge and skills on one hand, and money on the other.

The newly established Jai Swaminarayan Group started conducting regular meetings and saving every month. They received the required training from CARE India’s project team on aspects related to dairy management, SHG book keeping and accounting. Additionally, some of the women received special training on dairying.

In January 2019, the milk collection centre was established in the village, registered as Doodh Dhara – The Bharuch Cooperative Society of Government. Within a short period of time, by utilising the savings from the group, they purchased utensils, a computer and machine for calculating the fat content in the milk, some of the basic requirements for opening the Centre, along with a structured governance mechanism. Milk collection varies according to the season. From March to July, the milk collection is limited to 135 litres per day and increases to about 200 litres between August to February. The cost per litre is estimated according to the fat content in the milk.

The group is now planning to expand the concept of a milk collection centre to other villages, and increase the supply to the cooperative, which is currently titled as a proposed dairy, not a registered entity yet. To bring in value addition to the centre, the women are considering broadening the scope of collection through milk collection vans. The milk collection centre offers a good and assured price for the milk delivered by the members, without any exploitation. In addition, cattle-owners who generate small quantities of surplus milk, but cannot afford to travel long distances to sell it, get the chance to enhance their incomes.

The Improved Agriculture and Inclusive Dairy Value Chain Promotion (IAIDVC) project focusses on the economic empowerment of women smallholders and workers to achieve the goal of long-term development in 59 villages of Jambusar block in Bharuch district, Gujarat.</p>

                <p>A strong woman stands up for herself, a stronger woman stands up for others.

Kiran’s story from Jirapur village, Dhar district, Madhya Pradesh

When CARE India commenced its intervention under the Women + Water Programme,<span id="dots3">...</span><span id="more3"> Kiran was chosen as the mobiliser as she was active and had good interaction and acceptance in the village. She lives in a small village with her family that includes two daughters, aged 14 and three. Kiran had completed her studies till the class 12. This programme helped her to realise that she was learning something useful and essential. Topics like problem-solving, decision making, time and stress management, effective communication, WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene), and financial management touched important aspects of her life.

The session on WASH touched her the most. She remembers the struggles she faced during her menstruations in addition to the pain, embarrassment and emotional ups and downs due to the absence of proper counselling and advice. Menstruation has always been surrounded by taboos and myths that exclude women from many aspects of socio-cultural life. Low knowledge levels and understanding of puberty, menstruation, and reproductive health make the situation worse for women like her. Realising that there is scope and a need for the right type of counselling and advice for adolescents in and around the age of attaining puberty, she decided to fill the gap.

She has been promoting the use of sanitary napkins and passing on good hygiene practices to lessen the stress on girls, while discouraging the traditional unhygienic methods and practices around menstruation and hygiene. During menstruation, women and girls are considered to be impure in her village, hence not allowed to lift water using their hands. Standing near the hand pump, she was able to identify the women and girls who were in the middle of their periods. And thus she started her awareness building initiative at the Anganwadi centre.

So far, she has been able to reach around 50-60 young women taught them ways to overcome the challenges they face during periods. Her aim is to educate every girl in the village about menstrual hygiene before they start menstruating. She believes that it should not come to them as a surprise; instead, they should be aware and prepared.

Kiran doesn’t want them to suffer and struggle as she did in her younger days. According to her, to dispel the myths and taboos around menstruation are a big challenge, but she feels that proper hygiene practices can be beneficial and minimise their stress and embarrassment.

We salute change-makers like her.

CARE India is working with USAID and Gap Inc. as a partner of the Women + Water Alliance (W+W) to improve and sustain the health and well-being of 200,000 women by inculcating sanitation and hygiene (WASH) practices and working towards the availability and sharing of quality water resources in a sustained manner.
